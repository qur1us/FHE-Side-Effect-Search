# FHE-Side-Effect-Search
This is a project for my Modern Cryptography course at Brno University of Technology. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate a privacy preserving database query system. The project utilizes homomorphic encryption to query data from a database based on sensitive patient information without revealing it to the server that holds the database.
